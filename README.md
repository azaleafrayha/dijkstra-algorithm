# Shortest Path Algorithm
This project is based on one of the certification progress on the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) Scientific Computing with Python curriculum. I'm still halfway done to complete the project.

## Things I have learned from this project:
* **About Dijkstra**: Basically, Dijkstra is like a super-efficient scout. Instead of wandering aimlessly, it systematically finds the shortest path from a starting point to every other node in a network.

* **Graph and Algorithm**: I learned by visualizing the logic (Nodes & Edges) 
    * Nodes (the dots): These are the destinations, just like cities on a map, routers in a network, or people in a group.
    * Edges (The Lines): These are the connections, like the roads, the cables, or the friendships that link the nodes together.

    Dijkstra’s algorithm is basically just a very smart traveler moving across these edges to find the most efficient way to visit all the nodes. And inn my opinion, visualizing the logic made the code so much easier to write.

* **Dictionary** `{}`: Dictionary is like a storage box and everything inside it has a specific tags. The tags are `keys`and the contents inside the box are `values`.

* **Dict Comprehension**: Comprehension makes the code more readable and cleaner. And I learned that dict comprehension can also be used in if/else conditions.
